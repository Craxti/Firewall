# Firewall

This is a firewall application developed in Python.


## How It Works

The firewall application is designed to process incoming packets on a network interface and apply various security measures. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. The application starts by initializing the network interface and threat detector.

2. Incoming packets are continuously received on the network interface.

3. Each packet is processed by the firewall, which includes the following steps:
   - Logging the packet processing on the interface.
   - Checking the packet for any threats using the threat detector.
   - Applying any defined rules or filters to determine if the packet should be blocked or allowed.

4. If a threat is detected or a rule is matched, the firewall logs the event and takes appropriate action, such as blocking the packet or generating an alert.

5. The firewall continues to process incoming packets as long as the application is running.
