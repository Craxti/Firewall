# Firewall System

The Firewall System is a Python-based application that provides network traffic filtering and security capabilities. It allows you to define rules based on conditions and actions to control the flow of network packets.

## Features

- Rule-based filtering: Define rules based on conditions and actions to control packet flow.
- Flexible conditions: Define conditions based on IP address, port number, protocol, and payload content.
- Versatile actions: Perform actions such as blocking, allowing, logging, modifying packets, redirecting, and more.
- Packet processing: Implement custom packet processors for advanced analysis and handling.
- Rule chaining: Process rules sequentially, allowing each rule's action to influence subsequent processing.
- Automated testing: Includes a test suite for automated testing of firewall functionality.
